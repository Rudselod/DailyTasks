    <h1>Rudselod's Task Tracker</h1>
    <h2>Purpose of the website</h2>
    <p>I created this website mostly for my personal use, since i was keeping track of the work i was doing,
    through the day, using an text system. I would type what time i was starting and finishing tasks. 
    And thought it would make my tracking a lot easier if i could just push buttons to keep track of when
    and how long i work on projects.
    </p>
    <p>
    This website is still vary much in development, as i am just starting down my own coding journey and 
    I'm just learning the needed JavaScript as i want to add more functions to the website or improve on the 
    current functions.
    </p>
    <h2>Function of website</h2>
    <p>
    The website would function as a tracker for when you start and finish tasks as well as keeping track
    of how long you worked on the tasks. Currently I'm not saving any data yet, so if you want to save the
    progress through the day, just go to the share option on mobile and select the print option,
    to save as PDF on your device, or use the print screen option option, instead of selecting the printer,
    select print PDF to save to your device.
